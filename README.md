Time Series Forecasting with CO2 Emission Dataset
Overview
This repository contains notebooks and a CO2 emission dataset for univariate time series forecasting. The aim is to provide foundational learning material for students of AREWA DATA SCIENCE ACADEMY.
Notebooks
1.	ARIMA Model - Default Hyperparameters
•	This notebook explores univariate time series forecasting using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model with default hyperparameters.
2.	ARIMA Model - Hyperparameter Tuning
•	In this notebook, we aim to enhance the performance of the ARIMA model by tuning hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
3.	Support Vector Regression (SVR) - Default Hyperparameters
•	Here, we apply univariate time series forecasting using Support Vector Regression (SVR) with default hyperparameters.
4.	Support Vector Regression (SVR) - Hyperparameter Tuning
•	This notebook focuses on improving SVR model performance by tuning hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
5.	Linear Regression Model
•	Explore univariate time series forecasting using a simple Linear Regression model.
Dataset
The dataset used in these notebooks consists of CO2 emission data, suitable for univariate time series forecasting experiments.
Goal
The primary goal of this repository is to provide educational resources for understanding time series forecasting techniques. By leveraging real-world CO2 emission data, students can gain practical insights into applying various forecasting models and techniques.
